# Tailwind Formatter

Tailwind formatter is a port of [Headwind](https://github.com/heybourn/headwind) for use with Intellij/Phpstorm/Webstorm. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order.

## Usage
Code -> Run Tailwind Formatter

## Class Order
The default class order is available under src/TailwindUtility. Custom classes will automatically be pushed to the back
of the class list. Duplicated classes will also be removed.
